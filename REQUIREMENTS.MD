Project Title: Employee Management System
Overview:
The Employee Management System is a Java-based web application developed using Spring Boot
and Thymeleaf. It is designed to streamline and digitize employee records, operations, and
performance management. The system enables secure access, centralized data storage, and efficient
reporting to assist HR and administrative teams.
Project Objectives:
1. Efficient Employee Record Management:
Replace paper-based records with structured digital storage.
Provide easy options to search, update, and manage employee data.
2. User-Friendly Interface:
Use Thymeleaf for rendering dynamic HTML pages with a clean, intuitive UI.
Designed to be accessible for HR personnel without requiring technical expertise.
3. Role-Based Access Control:
Implement role-based authorization (e.g., Admin, HR Staff).
Admins have full access including user management; HR can view and update records only.
4. Centralized Data Storage:
Store all employee information in a MySQL database.
Eliminate data duplication and maintain consistency across the system.
5. Performance Tracking and Reporting:
Allow supervisors to enter performance data for employees.
Generate reports for appraisals, promotions, and HR planning.
Functional Requirements:
1. Employee Registration:
Admins or HR staff can register new employees.
Fields include: Name, Employee ID, Department, Position, Salary, Contact Information, and
Date of Joining.
2. View Employee Details:Display a searchable list of all employees.
Search by name, ID, or department.
3. Update Employee Information:
HR can update employee details (e.g., promotions, salary changes, contact info).
4. Delete Employee Record:
Admins can delete records of employees who have left the organization.
5. Authentication and Role Management:
Secure login system with username and password.
Define access permissions based on user roles (Admin, HR).
6. Attendance and Leave Management:
Record daily attendance.
Employees can request leave; HR can approve or reject requests.
7. Performance Review:
Managers can enter performance reviews and ratings.
Data used for evaluations and promotional decisions.
8. Report Generation:
Generate downloadable reports:
Employee lists
Salary summaries
Attendance logs
Export options: PDF and Excel.
9. Database Integration:
Use JDBC or Spring Data JPA to connect with MySQL.
Perform CRUD operations on employee data.
10. Error Handling and Data Validation:
Validate inputs (e.g., phone numbers, emails, dates).
Provide user-friendly error messages for invalid data or system failures.
